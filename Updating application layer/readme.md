⚠️ Security Best Practice 

Although SSH is enabled

It should not be open to everyone in production

Best practice includes

Restricting SSH to a trusted IP range

Using key pairs instead of passwords

Disabling SSH when not required

Using Bastion Hosts production

In this project, SSH is enabled for learning, validation purposes.
